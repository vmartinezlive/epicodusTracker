_Ask the user for their name and address them directly in all of the responses to them: "Enrique, you ought to study Java, so you can learn how to make mobile apps for Android!"_
_Make questions multiple choice (like a, b, or c); determine which track is right for a user by identifying the letter that was most frequently selected; for example, "You chose mostly a's, you should definitely study C#!"._
